This is a static website with a simple gallery app written with vanilla JavaScript, meant to meet the following requirements.

* HTML
	* Includes a `<link>` to a separate CSS file that styles your page. Don't add CSS styles directly to your HTML file.
	* Includes a `<script>` to a separate JavaScript file that adds interaction/functionality to your page. Don't add JavaScript code directly to your HTML file.
	* Meets the other normal (required) parts of any HTML page for it to be valid.
* CSS
	* Any amount of CSS you'd like to add to your project to style it, but there should at least be some styles added.
* JavaScript
	* Contains basic data types - Strings, Numbers, Booleans.
	* Contains an array.
	* Uses event listeners (AKA "event handlers").
	* Uses loops (for or while).
	* Uses Conditionals (i.e. if, else if, else).
